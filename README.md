<p>This project was developed as part of the <strong>Technologies of the Internet</strong> course in the Computer Science and Engineering degree during the academic year 2020/2021.</p>

<h1>Project Description:</h1>
<p>The goal of the SmartCar project was to design a web-based system that allows real-time monitoring and control of vehicle functions, such as sensor management and diagnostics. We implemented features for managing vehicle data, environmental sensor information, and user authentication. This project integrates frontend and backend technologies to deliver a complete interface for vehicle status updates.</p>

<p>Developed using PHP, CSS, and Python for data processing, this project is both an educational exercise in web technologies and a functional vehicle management tool.</p>
